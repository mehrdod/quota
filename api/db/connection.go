package db

/*
!!!!!!!!!
ATTENTION: DB part of code should be here BUT it is in models package
because we use just arrays instead of real Database.
If we put those code here we get "import cycle not allowed" ERROR, because of models.Quota import

In the real application with normal DB this will not happen!!! and structure will be beautiful
!!!!!!!!!
